      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
            <p>
              This policy applies to the app Syloti Keyboard, available on iOS. 
              It is current as of 13 February, 2022.
            </p>
            <h2>Information collected</h2>
            <p>
              This app collects no identifying information — no keystroke or 
              typing data is collected, and no login is required to use Syloti 
              keyboard. The only sort of information collected is that Apple 
              collects crash logs and statistics regarding use of the app. 
              All this information is anonymous and aggregated, used to help  
              improve the app. If you would like your information to be removed, 
              do not hesitate to reach out. This app complies with the California 
              Online Privacy Protection Act, and will not distribute your personal 
              information to outside parties without your consent. This app does 
              not collect information from anyone under 13, and no part of the 
              app is aimed at anyone under 13.
            </p>
            <h2>For European Union Consumers</h2>
            <p>
              By using Syloti Keyboard and providing your information, you 
              authorize this to collect, use, and store your information 
              outside of the European Union.
            </p>
            <h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>
            <p>
              Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the 
              country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across 
              jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data 
              depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Consent, and Contact Info</h2>
            <p>
              By using Syloti Keyboard, you consent to its privacy policy.
            If you have any questions about the privacy policy or would like to 
            request deletion of your information, you can reach out <a href="mailto:anais@anais.cc">here</a>.
