            <h2>Syloti Keyboard</h2>
            <p>
                Syloti Keyboard is an app for writing the Syloti Nagri script, 
                used for writing the Sylheti language, which is spoken by 
                eleven million people in northeastern Bangladesh and India. 
                The earliest known work using the script comes from 1549, and 
                it was used continuously until the 20th century, when the 
                language was discouraged in writing in favour of Bengali. 
                Nowadays, it is experiencing a revitalization movement, with 
                Sylhetis both in South Asia and in the diaspora looking to 
                write Sylheti using its traditional script. Sylheti Keyboard is 
                built in Swift for iOS 12.0 and above, and provides a keyboard 
                for iOS users to be able to write Syloti Nagri on their devices. 
                You can find the link for the app on the App Store <a href=
                "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/syloti-keyboard/id1515279890">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>For non-iOS users</h2>
            <p>
                If you are interested in typing Syloti Nagri on Android, Gboard 
                now has a Syloti Nagri keyboard available. In addition, there 
                are a few standalone apps on Android as well, such as <a
                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.nagrikeyboard">
                this one</a>, but I have not used any of them myself. For 
                Windows users, the Sylheti Translation And Research group have 
                released <a href="http://www.sylheti.org.uk/unicode-font">
                an installer</a> made in <a href=
                "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134">
                MSKLC</a> for a Sylheti keyboard layout, along with their font 
                Surma, which I highly recommend for anyone. For Ubuntu 20.04 users, 
                I made a shell script <a href=
                "https://github.com/ananari/syl-ubuntu-install">here</a> which 
                will install the keyboard layout I personally use, based on 
                InScript - no guarantees on it working on other versions of 
                Ubuntu, or for other distros.
